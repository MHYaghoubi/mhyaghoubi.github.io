Abstract:
We provide insight into the energetics of a Brownian oscillator in contact with a heat bath and driven by an external unbiased time-periodic force that takes the system out of thermodynamic equilibrium. Solving the corresponding Langevin equation, we compute the average kinetic and potential energies in the long-time stationary state. We also derive the energy balance equation and study the energy flow in the system. In particular, we identify the energy delivered by the external force, the energy dissipated by a thermal bath and the energy provided by thermal equilibrium fluctuations. Next, we illustrate the Jarzynski work-fluctuation relation and consider the stationary state fluctuation theorem for the total work done on the system by external force. Finally, by determining time scales in the system, we analyze the strong damping regime and discuss the problem of overdamped dynamics when inertial effects can be neglected.
