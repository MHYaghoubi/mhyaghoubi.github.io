I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Integrated Program in Neuroscience (IPN) at McGill University. My research focuses on machine learning approaches to develop better tools for analyzing neuronal and behavioral data. Before starting my Ph.D., I was an M.Sc. in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Calgary, where I was working on using statistical physics for understanding the statistics of collective dynamics of the population of neurons.
